Paper title: A study on cross-project fault prediction through resampling and feature reduction along with source projects selection

Content: The content folder consists of datasets utilized in this work
SRES.py: SRES.py is the Python file, which consists of three phases:
    Phase 1: Similarity and applicability computation
    Phase 2: Resampling of source data
    Phase 3: Feature reduction
All these phases are included in a single SRES.py file. Running SRES.py will give results for all the datasets given in the content folder.
